This is the code to generate the model and results from the JGR:Oceans paper - \cb2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Model predictions of wave overwash extent into the marginal ice zone (2022).\

\fs24 The model is described in that paper, and more broadly everything is based on the coupled floe\'97wave motions.  The actual code (solver) to do this is a black box,  and was used to generate the Coefficient Matrices. From the matrices the overwash model is derived and is used to create - \
	- Fig 4 qualitative results showing dependence on frequency (omega), length (L) and thickness (d)\
	- Validation - for the wooden disk motions (with various frequencies)\
	- Predictions - for the predictions in Section 5 (various frequencies, thicknesses and lengths) - this has to be done in segments due to the size of it.\
\
Once the matrices are generated, then Extent, Qualitative and Simulations can be run using the coefficients stored in the matrices.
